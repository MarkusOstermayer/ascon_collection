Implementations of the Ascon Family
===================================

This is a collection of hardware and software implementations of Ascon.
Reference implementations are included as submodules, while this file lists additional implementations in various languages.

:warning: Some repositories implement the published draft of [NIST SP 800-232 (initial public draft)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/232/ipd), while others implement the submitted candidate design, which are not compatible.
Linked implementations may become outdated or incorrect and should not be used for productive environments without caution.


About Ascon
-----------

[Ascon](https://ascon.isec.tugraz.at) is a family of [authenticated encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) (AEAD) and [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) algorithms designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, even with added countermeasures against side-channel attacks.
It was designed by a team of cryptographers from Graz University of Technology, Infineon Technologies, and Intel Labs: Christoph Dobraunig, Maria Eichlseder, Florian Mendel, and Martin Schläffer.

Ascon has been selected as the standard for lightweight cryptography in the [NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition (2019–2023)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography) and as the primary choice for lightweight authenticated encryption in the final portfolio of the [CAESAR competition (2014–2019)](https://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-submissions.html).

**The most recent version** of Ascon is specified in [NIST SP 800-232 (initial public draft)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/232/ipd) and includes the following designs:

  * Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD):

    - `Ascon-AEAD128` with 128-bit key, nonce, and tag
  
  * Hashing algorithms:
  
    - `Ascon-Hash256` with fixed 256-bit output size (hash function)
    - `Ascon-XOF128` with variable output lengths (eXtendable Output Function, XOF)
    - `Ascon-CXOF128` with variable output lengths and supporting a customization string as an additional input (Customizable XOF)


**Prior versions** (Ascon v1.2 as submitted to NIST LWC) and other non-standardized family members include:

  * Authenticated encryption (`Ascon-128`, `Ascon-128a`, `Ascon-80pq`)
  
  * Hashing algorithms including hash functions with fixed 256-bit tag size (`Ascon-Hash`, `Ascon-Hasha`) and eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs) with variable output lengths (`Ascon-Xof`, `Ascon-Xofa`)

  * Authentication algorithms including Message Authentication Codes (MACs) with fixed 128-bit tag size (`Ascon-Mac`, `Ascon-Maca`)
  and PseudoRandom Functions (PRFs) with variable output lengths (`Ascon-Prf`, `Ascon-Prfa`), as well as a variant for short messages of up to 128 bits (`Ascon-PrfShort`)
